description: Stage changed files, commit with the supplied message, and push to the current branch. Use this when the user wants to save and push their work.

First, run `git status` and `git diff --stat` and show me the output so I can see what has changed.

Then stage the changed files explicitly by name — do not use `git add -A`.

Write a commit with this message: `$ARGUMENTS`

Finally, push to the upstream of the current branch.
